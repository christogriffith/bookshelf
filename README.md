# bookshelf

I write software for a living, and I believe in maintaining a FIRM work/life balance. So this code, being part of my "life," sucks out loud.

This is hobbbyist nonsense that would fail every code review I've ever been a part of. And that's OK. Because it makes pretty colors on a bookshelf in my living room. Does your living room have a bookshelf you made with actual lumber and a table saw and glue and nails and some wires where you might want some lights? Mine does. Honestly, I like woodworking a lot more than I do writing software. But, y'know, 2019. 

Q: "I AM A SOFTWARE PERSON, I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT ABSTRACTION LAYERS IN MY FREE TIME." 
A: Abstract yourself from this project.
